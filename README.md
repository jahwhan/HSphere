# 🧠 HSphere – Synthetic Intelligence Training Ground

**HSphere** is an experimental, fully modular intelligence system designed to simulate and manage salon operations using synthetic data. Its purpose is to evolve into a **self-sufficient, self-governing, and self-improving AI ecosystem**, capable of integrating real-world APIs like Phorest in the future.

---

## 🌐 Vision

> Build the most advanced AI-driven salon operating system using synthetic simulation as a **sandbox for perfection** — until it's ready to soak in real-world data like a **sponge drinking a lake**.

## ✅ Current Capabilities

- 🧠 Synthetic client/stylist behavior simulation  
- 💇‍♂️ Intelligent booking logic + availability parsing  
- 📦 Simulated inventory updates  
- 🔁 Real-time memory + feedback logging  
- 🛠 Prompt-driven agent behavior  
- 🧬 Self-improvement module refactors agents via OpenAI API  

---

## 🔜 Coming Soon

- 🌍 Phorest API integration  
- 📊 Dynamic dashboard + analytics
